the console the file name along with the date it was 
last modified.

###  SQLite3_Drill ###
This project found all the .txt files in a list of 
files. Then it will create a database unless one 
already exists. Here it will save the file names if 
the .txt files. Last it retrieves all the information 
from the database and displays it in the console.
